Amazon product review scraper
=============================

I wrote this for the 'Content Analysis and NLP Summer school' at usi.ch in Lugano

There are a few short python sources. 

One for harvesting and scraping the html of reviews of Amazon products.
Another for parsing the html and extracting text files and csv.

Unit tested
=============================

The development of the Amazon reviews html parser was conducted using TDD; that's why you will find some html files: those are used by the unit tests.

I did not made tests for the scraper code.
